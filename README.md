O Name of the Price List (2020 Price List)
O Description
O Enable or disable Price List
▪ ONLY ONE ACTIVE AT THE SAME TIME
Or Products List with their prices.
(Product1 + Price, Product2 + Price, Product3 + Price)
Basic Operations (CRUD) for the product list:
O Product Code (ONLY) - See example of Products module => SOCCER-001
O Fixed Price => 200 bs.
O Promotion Price is calculated based on the fixed price according to the active campaign:

▪ If it is BLACK FRIDAY: 25%
▪ If there is no active campaign there is no promotional price
